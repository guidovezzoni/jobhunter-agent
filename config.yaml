# Default configuration for Job Hunter Agent.
#
# Copy this file and adjust values to create different searches, then run:
#   python main.py --config path/to/your-config.yaml
#
# Fields:
#   role             : Job title or role to search for.
#   location         : Free-text location; empty means any location.
#                      Special values that trigger multi-country European search:
#                        "europe", "eu", "european economic area"
#                      When one of these is used, the API is called once per
#                      country in europe_countries and results are merged.
#   date_posted      : API-level posting date filter: today, week, month, all.
#   location_types   : Optional list; any of: on-site, hybrid, remote.
#   position_types   : Optional list; any of: permanent, contract, freelance.
#   minimum_salary   : Optional integer minimum salary; null = no filter.
#   industry_filter  : Optional free-text industry filter; null = no filter.
#   language_filter  : Job spec language (e.g. "en", "any").
#   europe_countries : List of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes used when
#                      location is a Europe trigger. Each code causes one
#                      additional API call (pages × countries API requests
#                      total), so keep this list short on free-tier plans.

# Empty string means any location (no location restriction).

# Countries to search when location is "europe" / "eu" / "european economic area".
