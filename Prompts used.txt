==============================

I would like to build a 'Job Hunter Agent' in Python, that searches the web and API and filters results according to specific criteria.

The important job info are:
    - role
    - location

The general workflow is:
- Take user preferences: the following values should be requested to the user on launch, providing the default suggested.
    - Role (default is "Android Developer")
    - Location (default is empty, which means any location)
- Search via job boards / company sites via web search APIs or scraping endpoints. Use these criteria:
    - If a RAPID_API_KEY is available in .env use the JSearch API (RapidAPI), if the KEY is not available use the mocked response in `docs/RapidAPIResponse.txt` if present, if said file is not present warn the user and exit
    - Please note that mock file might be a Python-style (single quotes), not strict JSON
    - Tailor the request according to the API available parameters and the criteria defined in the important job info: if the API provides a role search parameter then use it, same for location
- Save the API response in debug/api-response using a timestamp based filename down to the seconds, to avoid overridings.
- Extract key job info
    - location type = on-site/hybrid/remote or not defined. This could be stated explicitly or should be extrapolated from the job spec.
    - position type = permanent position, contract, freelance or not defined.
    - minimum salary - if provided
    - industry - if available
    - job spec language - this should be understood from the job ad: if the job ad is Spanish and they require English knowledge, the result of this field will still be Spanish
    - tech stack - this should be extracted from the job ad if present
    - requirements for the job
    - job link
- Generate a tailored summary with the key job info and other info you deem important

Additional requirements:
- Please add/update README.md and AGENTS.md and keep them updated when applying additional changes.

Please define the above workflow in plain language

Now I'd like to add an additional filtering on the results already obtained from the endpoint.
I'd like to be able to filter on these values:
    - Location type should be none or more of on-site/hybrid/remote (default is none, which means no filtering, it could be all of them or none at all)
    - Position type any of permanent position, contract, freelance (default is empty, which means no filtering, it could be all of them or none at all)
    - minimum salary (default no minimum)
    - industry (default not defined)
    - job spec language (default english)
The above values should be added to the initial request of values to the user: role and location will be used for the API call, the other values will be used for the following filtering.
Also, the API call result should be cached and re-used for the following 60 minutes, if and only if role and location are the same, the following filtering should be performed every time instead.
Finally, please update README.md and AGENTS.md and keep them updated when applying additional changes.
