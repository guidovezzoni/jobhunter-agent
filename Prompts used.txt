List of main prompts used.
==========================

I would like to build a 'Job Hunter Agent' in Python, that searches the web and API and filters results according to specific criteria.

The important job info are:
    - role
    - location

The general workflow is:
- Take user preferences: the following values should be requested to the user on launch, providing the default suggested.
    - Role (default is "Android Developer")
    - Location (default is empty, which means any location)
- Search via job boards / company sites via web search APIs or scraping endpoints. Use these criteria:
    - If a RAPID_API_KEY is available in .env use the JSearch API (RapidAPI), if the KEY is not available use the mocked response in `docs/RapidAPIResponse.txt` if present, if said file is not present warn the user and exit
    - Please note that mock file might be a Python-style (single quotes), not strict JSON
    - Tailor the request according to the API available parameters and the criteria defined in the important job info: if the API provides a role search parameter then use it, same for location
- Save the API response in debug/api-response using a timestamp based filename down to the seconds, to avoid overridings.
- Extract key job info
    - location type = on-site/hybrid/remote or not defined. This could be stated explicitly or should be extrapolated from the job spec.
    - position type = permanent position, contract, freelance or not defined.
    - minimum salary - if provided
    - industry - if available
    - job spec language - this should be understood from the job ad: if the job ad is Spanish and they require English knowledge, the result of this field will still be Spanish
    - tech stack - this should be extracted from the job ad if present
    - requirements for the job
    - job link
- Generate a tailored summary with the key job info and other info you deem important

Additional requirements:
- Please add/update README.md and AGENTS.md and keep them updated when applying additional changes.

Please define the above workflow in plain language

Now I'd like to add an additional filtering on the results already obtained from the endpoint.
I'd like to be able to filter on these values:
    - Location type should be none or more of on-site/hybrid/remote (default is none, which means no filtering, it could be all of them or none at all)
    - Position type any of permanent position, contract, freelance (default is empty, which means no filtering, it could be all of them or none at all)
    - minimum salary (default no minimum)
    - industry (default not defined)
    - job spec language (default english)
The above values should be added to the initial request of values to the user: role and location will be used for the API call, the other values will be used for the following filtering.
Also, the API call result should be cached and re-used for the following 60 minutes, if and only if role and location are the same, the following filtering should be performed every time instead.
Finally, update README.md and AGENTS.md accordingly.

Map this project to an “agent pattern”:
- Planner: decides which steps to run.
- Tools: web search call, filter logic, email generator.
- Memory/config: user preferences so it feels personal.

Finally, update README.md and AGENTS.md and keep them updated when applying additional changes.

Now I'd like to add a config.yaml file that provides the default criteria suggested to the user.
Also, I'd like to have a command line switch to provide a yaml file as a parameter: when this happens no values should be requested to the user as they would be read from the yaml file.
This way a can prepare different yaml for different searches and run them without having to tailor each search.
Please create the default config.yaml file which will serve as a template for other customised yaml.
Finally, update README.md and AGENTS.md accordingly.

There is currently a short recap of parameters and results before the summary, could you please move that after the summary?
Please ensure it includes:
- Parameters values
- If the API was called or if the cached was used
- Number of entries retrieved before filtering
- Number of entries available after filtering
Please ensure the recap is printed even when the  API/cache do not return any result.
